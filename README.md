# Diamond Price Prediction
The Diamond Price Prediction project aims to forecast the price of diamonds based on various characteristics. By utilizing a Random Forest algorithm, this project provides insights into the factors that influence diamond prices.

## Introduction
Diamonds are valued based on multiple features, including carat, cut, color, and clarity. This project investigates how these attributes impact diamond pricing, employing machine learning techniques to develop an accurate predictive model.


## Methodology
Data Preprocessing: The data is cleaned to handle missing values and categorical variables are encoded for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and statistical analyses are conducted to understand the relationships between features and diamond prices.
Model Building: A Random Forest regression model is built and trained on the processed dataset.
Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared.

### Results
The Random Forest model achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of X and an R-squared score of Y, indicating a strong predictive capability. Key insights include the significant influence of carat size on price and the effect of cut quality on diamond value.

### The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 97%
